# The Hogwarts Bestiary
## Introduction
"The Hogwarts Bestiary" is a data analysis project that serves as a type of "sorting hat" of magical creatures into the four Hogwarts houses: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. This repository includes the interactive Bestiary and the analysis used for the sorting.

## Project Overview 
This project utilizes a custom-developed sorting algorithm to classify magical creatures based on a dataset created from information on the Ministry of Magic's Classification List. The analysis includes data cleaning, sorting, and visualization, providing insights into the characteristics and house alignment of each creature.

## Methodology 
- Data cleaning and preparation using Python.
- Development of "the sorting hat", i.e. the sorting function to classify creatures.
- Statistical analysis of the creatures in each house to determine any possible patterns or defining characteristics.
- Creation of interactive visualizations.

## Results
- Successful alignment of creatures into Hogwarts houses.
- Visualizations that highlight the defining characteristics of each house.

## Acknowledgments & References
This project was inspired by my children's new-found love of Harry Potter. Being a fan myself, their curiosity and excitement reignited my own, which is how the idea of this project came to be.

The [dataset](https://github.com/phelpsbp/The-Hogwarts-Bestiary/blob/main/updated_new_creatures_dataset.xlsx) was created entirely myself through webscraping and extensive research. The Harry Potter fan community was a huge source in gathering the not-so-easy to find information on the creatures for the dataset. Particularly:
- [The Monster Blog of Monsters](https://themonsterblogofmonsters.tumblr.com/)
- [Harry Potter Wiki](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Ministry_of_Magic_Classification#Classified_beasts)

All creature images were generated myself using a custom GPT that I created. All images are free to use, avoid content policy restrictions, and are free from copyright issues. 
All headers, artwork, and dashboards for 'The Hogwarts Bestiary' were designed by me. If you wish to use any of these materials, please contact me.
